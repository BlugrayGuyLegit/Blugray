    <h1>Blugray</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>Blugray</strong> is a musical, mysterious figure and the administrator of the Alpha Hills Laboratory formerly owned by the Government. Blugray has many emotions and ties and this wiki contains all of them.</p>
        
        <h2>Ties</h2>
        <p><span class="tie">Red Tie:</span> Mostly angry, not in a good mood. Can do anything to achieve his goals.</p>
        <p><span class="tie">Gray Tie:</span> A silent and fun tie. It might become boring but acts better than the other two.</p>
        <p><span class="tie">Dark Tie/Black Tie:</span> The control force of Blugray and also the most mysterious tie ever. Not much information is available about this tie; however, it has appeared in Skibidi Toilet and in the Demand and 2Lonely music videos.</p>

        <h2>Blugray</h2>
        <p>The owner and controller of all ties. Activates each tie in different situations. His known abilities are teleportation, mind manipulation, camera POV hacking, immortality, and others that are unknown for now. Each tie also has its favourite song but I'm not including them because the creators can strike me.</p>

        <p>Besides the ties, Blugray is also the author, creator, producer, and animator of all. Blugray is mistakenly named "Secret Agent" in Skibidi Toilet; however, it is not his real name, so do not trust people calling him Secret Agent. Blugray is the leader of the neutral team in Skibidi Toilet, which was formerly owned by the government of Alpha Hills Lab. It is also mistaken that Blugray lives in Georgia or USA; do not trust people calling his location from these countries. He is a Russian who lives in Southern Russia near Georgia.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Music Videos</h2>
        <p>In 2021, Boom wanted to do something new, so he left his content and started making Blugray music videos. However, due to lack of views, he quit making the music videos and privated the Blugray playlist and all the music videos. In this section of the page, we discuss the music videos, so let's break down all the music videos:</p>

        <h3>Demand</h3>
        <p>Demand is the first ever Blugray music video to be uploaded on the channel. The music video explains Blugray's horrible life in Russia under Mr. P (aka Putin), who is in the form of a TV man and controls the city with his military cameramen. Note: The TV man and cameramen have nothing to do with Skibidi Toilet; they represent Putin and his army. Demand also contains Blugray's suicidal, mental, and physical problems. The duration of the video is almost 6 minutes. We also saw the dark tie in Demand for the first time.</p>

        <h3>Embracing</h3>
        <p>Embracing was created after Demand and started the beginning of all other ties besides the dark tie, which first appeared in Demand. Embracing expresses Blugray's feelings of happiness and how he no longer suffers from any problems. Embracing also introduces Epic Blugray, which is a better version of him and loves the night and the rain. Epic Blugray's power is also in Skibidi Toilet. For example, when Blugray teleports, a green glow appears. Epic Blugray also has that power, but it is mixed with yellow color. In Embracing, we also saw a mysterious girl who is still unknown to date. However, it is believed she is Blugray's girlfriend or wife. Epic Blugray beats all his demons in the music video, representing his problems being fixed when they get beaten up.</p>

        <h3>2Lonely</h3>
        <p>2Lonely is a music video about Blugray's loneliness. The video is also one of the only music videos that contain the dark tie besides Demand. We also see some dark figures later in the video, which were reused for large cameramen in Skibidi Toilet. The dark figures are probably the problems that disturb Blugray. Blugray is trapped in a room where he is lonely. The video also contains a photo of the mysterious girl from Embracing, which later goes away due to a flood. Blugray becomes extremely angry at the end, kills all the dark figures, and finally calms down.</p>

        <p>Other music videos contain some of Blugray's life incidents and also 2 instrumental videos:</p>

        <h3>Yaint Shit</h3>
        <p>Yaint Shit explains how much Blugray suffers while animating for hours nonstop and how his fans just don't care if he lives or dies; they just want videos. The computer in Yaint Shit is represented as the fan. Blugray gets no rest, and at the end, he has to throw away all his loved ones.</p>

        <h3>Farewell Mr. P</h3>
        <p>This song is all about Mr. P. Blugray wants to kill/assassinate Mr. P for the good of the country and basically roasts him.</p>

        <h3>Bonus</h3>
        <p>As said earlier, in other music videos, there are 2 instrumental tracks which have no original versions because they don't exist. One is "Sadness," a sad song. The other is an unreleased song, "Bleak," which is probably a rap song like "Yaint Shit."</p>

        <p>And that's it. Thank you for reading!</p>
