  <h1>- Full skibidi toilet storylines</h1>
  <p>First of all, we are going to review the <b>Skibidi</b> <b>Toilet</b> and its origins.<br><br>
The <b>Skibidi</b> <b>Toilet</b> is a series created by the YouTuber of "<b>SFM</b> animations" "<b>DaFuq!?Boom!</b>", this series is made up of <b>toilets</b> who sing music straight from <b>tiktok</b>, it's a remix of "<b>give</b> it to me" by the <b>singer</b> named <b>Neli</b> <b>Furtado</b>.<br>
on the other side (the <b>protectors</b> of the world) the <b>cameramen</b>, <b>Speakeman</b> and <b>TVMan</b> or more quickly "<b>the</b> <b>alliance</b>" fights them in a <b>war</b> which we can call almost endless, on the side of the <b>skibidi</b> <b>Toilet</b> their leader is the <b>Gman</b> <b>Toilet</b> (<b>G-Toilet</b>) as well as later the "<b>Scientist</b> <b>Toilet</b>" which will become temporarily, on the <b>cameraman's</b> side the leader is still unknown at this time...<br><br>
- <b>Episode</b> 0 to <b>Episode</b> 20.<br><br>
The first <b>toilet</b> to exist is called the <b>OG-Toilet</b> for "<b>Original</b> <b>Toilet</b>", this <b>toilet</b> has only low power and does not yet know how to move it...<br>
later we discover more <b>toilets</b> such as:
The <b>Gman</b>, The <b>giant</b> <b>toilets</b>, The <b>urinals</b>, etc...<br><br>
- <b>Episode</b> 21 to 50.<br><br>
A long time later (<b>ep</b> 40+) we discover a new character, a mysterious character who observes the <b>fights</b>, he is dressed in an <b>Orange</b> <b>suit</b> and <b>glasses</b>, we quickly understand who it is.<br>
It's about the <b>creator</b>, but it's also about <b>Blugray</b>, a character who had been forgotten in the <b>darkness</b> of the <b>channel</b>...<br>
We also discover <b>women</b> for the first time with the first, <b>Girl</b> <b>Cameraman</b>, and after <b>TV</b> <b>Women</b> and subsequently <b>Camera</b> <b>women</b> and <b>Speaker</b> <b>Woman</b>.<br>
We also discover the <b>Titans</b>, the first was discovered at the beginning of the series it is "<b>Titan</b> <b>Cameraman</b>" but later we also discover <b>Titan</b> <b>SpeakerMan</b> and then from <b>episode</b> 41 we discover the <b>Titan</b> <b>TVMan</b> then after a few <b>episodes</b> became <b>Titan</b> <b>Cineman</b> and after being destroyed by the <b>Titan</b> <b>SpeakerMan</b> who was infected by a <b>Toilet</b> <b>parasite</b> created by the <b>Scientist</b> <b>Toilet</b> a long time ago...<br>
