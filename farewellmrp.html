Hey, hey
I'm going right, grab the clothes back the skin
Time for five shit before we steam
Bitch shot from the dry myself clean

All bitch try to digest me
Mr.p try to get me
Put a massacrety don't believe in shoot, hate!
but are you ready for receiving!?

Lord I know you digging all the holes to engrave me
thanks for the weekend I ain't got no time to spend it
living in the hell is no faith for the plain
I've been praying God all these years that I made

he make all I want but don't complain
so many times diary's born on my stage
I could stay alive in the country of my kindy
and I said, it's just time for a minute


all time all the fuckers trying to frame me
if you ain't an army in a union
you'll be done you'll be born in chairs
all the grainies concerned with different names
they don't care for none but they have dollars with their ladies
one day in the year they clean all the stains
brand new foreign new hustle for your famous babies
born every day to get lazy, angry or just squeezes...

(Corruption in the world still the mighty but the man never dissed the game of the poor friend)

leave the number 1 you don't see but it's in you
checking all your mind, all your thoughts just to steal
you selling down hay through the week
it's a market made it whole gives a head to your pocket
have you ever got a sense of fear for your talking shit is getting real
when the opposition's starving

nope no more they ain't a target
they're fucking ded, they're in jail
they're smarted now..

im on list of hundred like a billboard 
number one murder on sight, they're just some killers, im changing boy
ain't got nobody to fear put your fake card close show up with the villains...

Homeland, it's the middle of the rules
where you're a gladiator and above you are your leaders
make your front lap and backs be stacking lions on the way but you know you're lack

but it ain't on me
long ago I had a plan b
camera around what they can see
Im already there, look back, right behind mr.p

now he's just doing 
calm down you got wet p
Now listen carefull bitch!

Too long for this plane I'm leaving 
we're a legend if weak people feeling
where no ego maniac can be leading 
where this is no reason for the killing
So long for the plane I'm leaving 
we're a legend if weak people feeling
where no ego maniac can be leading 
Singing for the last time...
FAREWELL MR.P!!


Ha look, get away with a murder
And I will give you hundreds time between the line is needed
how many cops an army figures on doors else we need it
guess you lose the grip oh real and you got nothing to say it
Your body is alive but inside is feeling shave
it only couple lines gonna make a piece invaded
check me down hell and show them who's the real bitch
Don't need fucking kind when I throw this bar for killing!

Bring your fucking bombs
Come on, throw your fucking bombs
throw the doors you got left I'm squealing
throw all the shits if you won't see me kneeling

(wow, you got me! turning to agents...
but you know what that means too?
What about you >:) ? )

Yeah, drop that shit

Fire burn inside
Listener of the saint
Just another life (wow)
Fucking back again

run away and cry 
with your daughter by your side
Try to beat me now
I am stronger than you're capable to mind
(Thats it ?)

Too long for this plane I'm leaving
Where I'll bet you be free feeling
Where no every maniac can be leaning
where the difference no rhythms of the killing
Too long for the plane I'm leaving
Where election gives people feeling
Where no every maniac can be leaning
See the shoot on my ears... (Farewell mr.p)

Too long for this plane I'm leaving
Where I'll let you leave people feeling
Where no every maniac can be leaning
where the difference no rhythms of the killing
Sl long for the plane I'm leaving
Where I'll let you leave people feeling
See the shoot on my ears... (Farewell mr.p)
Sing for the last time...
Farewell Mr.p (Farewell Mr.p)
Goodbye mr.p (farewell mr.p)

I'm not your opportunity, you never control
Once, you be a loser at thing, try to get me now peace, you just missed the (god)
