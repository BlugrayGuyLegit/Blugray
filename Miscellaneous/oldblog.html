        <h1>QA Video Transcript</h1>
        <p>Hey everyone, it's me. The last time I promised to make a QA vlog was nine months ago. Oh my god, but I have an explanation for this. I was extremely busy and I also had some mental problems. I mean, I always experience mental problems but this was the worst. And now I have like 150 subscribers. That's awesome! So why not finally make this vlog I promised nine months ago?</p>

        <p>Basically, what I'm gonna be doing is reading your comments and questions under my last vlog where I revealed this. Let's go!</p>

        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
        <p><strong>Question number one by Victor Cengiz:</strong> The fuck?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> ...</p>

        <p><strong>Question number two by Mr. Rocketerman:</strong> What kind of questions are they? How old are you?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Finally, some normal question by Mr. Rocketerman. I am 20. My birthday is on 22 April.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you make more GTA memes?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Okay, so here's the situation. For GTA and Big Smoke reviews, I am not making them, but I got my sister into this, so now she is making Big Smoke memes. Not to say that she was the initiator of some Big Smoke videos, which means that she is the mastermind behind Big Smoke videos.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Japan? </p>
        
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Alright, Japan. What would you pay?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you have a gap between your teeth? Also, I like your San Andreas meme videos.</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I just never wore brackets, just the weirdest fucking machines.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are you gay?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I'm straight. Like, absolutely straight. Are you getting it? Damnit, I'm not gay. I'm barely even told.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> When are you gonna have this courtesan?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I already have one and it's empty. It's fucking empty. I'm the one guy here.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are you Japanese?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I'm not Japanese.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> So you're not a transformer?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Unfortunately, no.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you come up with your channel name?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, I was thinking about how to name it channel and I was thinking too much. I tried to give it a sense and then I was like, why not? I don't need to think about it a lot. So I was like, let's make it 'the fuck' from that meme where the guy screams 'what the fuck' and then explosion happens. That's it. That's just a stupid nickname.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you do Big Smoke?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, when I created this channel, I wasn't really planning to make Big Smoke videos. The Big Smoke meme was relevant these days and I decided, why not grow my channel on it? Don't think I use Big Smoke to grow my channel. I just liked this meme. I wouldn't be bothering myself doing it if I didn't like it.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Who are you?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, it looks like I'm a Japanese gay transformer.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Will you be doing any more GTA videos like with Nick or something?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I'm not, but Powercat probably will. Do you see my new video?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What's your video?</p>

        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Can you do Left4Dead videos?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Probably not, but I might use some Left4Dead characters in my videos.</p>

        <strong>Question:</strong> How far Japanese?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Zero in Japanese.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How are you in the water?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> What do you mean?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I swear?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Can I show up in your QA?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Wish grant cheese or chocolate?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Chocolate.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any more Transformers videos planned, or have you moved on from that?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I know a lot of you don't like these Transformers videos, but I have no choice. They monetize so well. I'm literally living on this, you know? So that's why I'm making these videos.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Brick, is that you?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I'm not. I don't even watch Game of Thrones.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you like chicken?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I don't eat chicken meat. I am a vegetable.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why Sophia?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, SFM is just an instrument to recreate some ideas. At first, I was using GMod, but then moved to SFM because of its advantages. It's a long story, so I'll save it for later.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you give me a number 9?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, but Big Smoke might if you ask him.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How many different projects do you have going at once, or do you only work on one at a time?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, I'm working now on "Make Your Time", "The Fuck Moments", and Transformers videos. They are in different stages of production, but they are all being made.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are some of your favorite games?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> My favorite game is "Source Filmmaker".</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you feel like you have gotten better or worse at making videos?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Better. Yes, better. Probably better in animating, better in storytelling. I do have some videos that I was lazy working on, like some Transformers videos, and that's why you might think I'm starting to become bad at them. But no, it's just because I'm lazy. When I'm interested in what I'm doing, I'm only getting better at it.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Who are some of your favorite GMod/SFM video makers?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I'm not going to remember all of them. A lot of GMod machinima makers actually inspired me to do this kind of work. Ben Burrows, Book Hakuna, Bond Bill did not understand what language this is.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Why not?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What country are you from?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I was born in Moscow, Russia, and I'm still in Moscow, Russia. I can't get out.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are you Russian?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, I'm Russian, but I'm also 20% Jewish.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you drink vodka?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I prefer water.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What kind of accent is that?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It's Russian trying to perform an American accent.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you wipe sitting or standing?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Who the fuck wipes sitting? You gotta put your hands in the toilet. You're gonna collect all the shit on your hand. Why would you wipe sitting?</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you have a GF?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You mean Gordon Freeman? Now master bitch please don't.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> So taking SFM as a hobby or as work?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It's both a hobby and work. It's hilarious.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a question for you: What's your advice in SFM?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It's a long story, so I'll save it for later.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What's it like living in Russia?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It was never really a problem for me, so I can't explain. Living in Russia is an adventure.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why do you look so natural in front of the camera?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Thanks.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What's your real name?</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> My name is Alexey, just like Alex but with an 'ey'.</p>

        <p><strong>Question:</strong> You're ugly.</p>

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> That's not a question, but it may be the answer to why I never had a girlfriend.</p>

        <p>Well, that was all the questions. Thanks for watching this video and thanks for asking questions. I appreciate it. It really feels like your shit is needed. Imagine someone on the other part of the world watching your videos that you created here in this room. At the moment I made the previous vlog, I had only like 50,000 subscribers, and right now I have 150,000, like three times more. That's cool. I already verified my channel and I already received this. Look at this computer. Look, there's no even fucking buttons.</p>

        <p>Also, here's a little announcement for those who wait for Big Smoke videos. There is gonna be one pretty cool Big Smoke video soon. By Powercat. She's doing it right now in the next room. She's busy with it. I can tell you that's gonna be a fucking masterpiece.</p>

        <p>For those who wait for "Make Your Time 3", there is gonna be this episode literally gonna drop. Here's a little spoiler from it.</p>

        <p>And for those who wait for "The Fuck Moments" videos, really? Is there someone who really waits for that? I promised at the beginning of the year that they were gonna be in 2018 and they are gonna be in 2018. I never break my promises. I'll do that. I'll do this.</p>

        <p>So that's all for now. Thanks for watching again. Subscribe to my channel, share it with your friends so they can also subscribe, so I can reach more subscribers and more views. See you in the next vlog, and I hope it's gonna be sooner than this one. This is done.</p>
